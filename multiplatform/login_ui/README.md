Flutter is a great platform for building complex and elegant UI that compiles to many platforms. But, sometimes a native solution can allow for greater functionality. for example, building apps for macOS in SwiftUI just **looks and feels** better. 

As a challenge, I decided to build the same login UI with both Flutter and SwiftUI to compile to iPhone, Android, iPad, and macOS.

I will lay this out in a side by side comparison so that the two frameworks can be directly compared in functionality and syntax.

## Assets

The needed assets can be found [here.](https://github.com/jake-landersweb/jake_code/tree/main/multiplatform/login_ui/assets)

Both projects will use apple.png and google.png, but because SwiftUI does not support packages out of the box, SwiftUI will utilize wave.png and Flutter will use wave svg.
