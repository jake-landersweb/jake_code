# Jake Landers

I am a mobile developer who first started working with Swift back in 2018, and then migrated to SwiftUI when that released. I have focused solely on iOS development for most of my career, but have started branching out into flutter for cross platorm support. Check out my [Github](https://github.com/jake-landersweb/jake_code) and this website for some examples of what I do.

## Content

I tend to get stuck with little UI / visual issues here and there when constructing my apps, and I want to share some of the fixes I have come up with as a result of those. All of the code on this webiste is free to use in anyway, and I hope it happens to help. If there are any questions, feel free to email me or leave a comment and I will try to reply in a timely manner.
